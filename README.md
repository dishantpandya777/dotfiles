# dotfiles

This repository contains the configuration files (i.e., "dotfiles") used to configure the programs regularly used by
[Gregory M.  Kapfhammer](http://www.cs.allegheny.edu/sites/gkapfham).  Please note that all of the dotfiles in this
repository are "hard-coded" to work for my development environment and projects.  But, even though they are heavily
customized, my hope is that they will give examples of how to configure various programs such as `zsh` and `tmux`.

## Installation Instructions

You can type the following command if you want to clone this repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/gkapfham/dotfiles.git
```

Now, you can type `cd dotfiles` and start to browse the configuration files that are available. I suggest that you make
symbolic links from your user's home directory to this repository if you want to create and use these configuration
files in a disciplined fashion.

## Problems or Praise?

If you have any problems with downloading or understanding these configuration files, then please create an issue
associated with this Git repository using the "Issues" link at the top of this site. As the sole contributor to the
`tmuxinator` repository, I will do everything possible to resolve your issue and ensure that all of the configurations
are clear and, potentially, best suited to working in your development environment.  Remember, this repository is being
made publicly available so as to provide examples of how to write configurations. If you find that these files help you
in preparing your own configurations, then I also encourage you to "star" and "watch" this project!
